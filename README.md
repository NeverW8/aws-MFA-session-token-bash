# aws-MFA-session-token-bash

This Bash script updates the AWS credentials file with a new session token generated by providing an MFA code. If the MFA serial number is not already present in the credentials file, it fetches it from AWS using the AWS CLI.

To run the script, save it to a file with a ".sh" extension, make it executable using "chmod +x filename.sh", and run it using "./filename.sh". You should be prompted to enter your MFA code.

Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials before running the script.

**Note**: The script overwrites the "aws_security_token" field in the credentials file if it already exists.
